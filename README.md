This website is an attempt to recreate a photography lab services site that is currently online (https://oldschoolphotolab.com/). The goal was to include a landing page that shows the lab services and a shopping page that shows items available for purchase. In addition, there is a contact page, which was created to satisfy the Javascript portion of the project.

The following are the requirements that are fulfilled for this project:
1. JavaScript requirement has been fulfilled by creating a form on the contact page that submits and displays an alert with all of the forms information.
2. The CSS requirement is fulfilled by the navigation menu which is responsive and changes with different media queries.
3. The additional requirement is fulfilled by the use of both CSS Grid and Flexbox in the CSS.

The font in use is Public Sans
The film images were borrowed from the website: https://thefindlab.ecwid.com/BUY-FILM-c29121455
